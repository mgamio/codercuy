You know you don't want to reinvent the wheel, so you look to Design Patterns: the lessons learned by those who've faced the same software design problems. This book shows you the patterns that matter, when to use them and why, how to apply them to your designs, and the object-oriented design principles on which they're based. With Design Patterns, you get to take advantage of the best practices and experience of others so you can spend your time on something more challenging. Something more fun. Join hundreds of thousands of developers who've improved their object-oriented design skills through Head First Design Patterns.

If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect: a visually rich format designed for how your brain works. With Head First Design Patterns, 2E, you'll learn design principles and patterns in a way that won't put you to sleep, so you can get out there to solve software design problems and speak the language of patterns with others on your team.
