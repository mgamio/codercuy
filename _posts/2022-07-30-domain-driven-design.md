Domain-Driven Design (DDD) software modeling delivers powerful results in practice, not just in theory, which is why developers worldwide are rapidly moving to adopt it. Now, for the first time, there’s an accessible guide to the basics of DDD: What it is, what problems it solves, how it works, and how to quickly gain value from it.

It is interesting the topic of Ubiquitous Language where the author emphasizes the importance of a consensual vocabulary among all team members involved in the same project. As developers, we need to choose the proper names for our variables that reflect that  Ubiquitous Language.

Vernon guides you through each core DDD technique for building better software. You’ll learn how to segregate domain models using the powerful Bounded Contexts pattern, to develop a Ubiquitous Language within an explicitly bounded context, and to help domain experts and developers work together to create that language. Vernon shows how to use Subdomains to handle legacy systems and to integrate multiple Bounded Contexts to define both team relationships and technical mechanisms.

Coverage includes

- What DDD can do for you and your organization–and why it’s so important
- The cornerstones of strategic design with DDD: Bounded Contexts and Ubiquitous Language
- Strategic design with Subdomains
- Context Mapping: helping teams work together and integrate software more strategically
- Tactical design with Aggregates and Domain Events
- Using project acceleration and management tools to establish and maintain team cadence
