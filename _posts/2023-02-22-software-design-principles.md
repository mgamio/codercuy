Software design principles are guidelines and best practices that help software developers create high-quality, maintainable, and efficient software. Here are some commonly recognized software design principles:

- SOLID: SOLID stands for Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion. These five principles help developers create software that is modular, extensible, and easy to maintain.

- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): The DRY principle states that code should not be repeated unnecessarily. Instead, developers should use abstractions, modularization, and other techniques to reduce repetition and make code more maintainable.

- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): The KISS principle suggests that developers should strive for simplicity and avoid unnecessary complexity. This makes code easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

- YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It): The YAGNI principle encourages developers to avoid writing code that may be needed in the future but is not necessary at present. This reduces complexity and saves time and effort.

- Separation of Concerns: This principle suggests that different concerns, such as user interface, data storage, and business logic, should be separated and handled independently. This makes code more modular, easier to maintain, and less prone to errors.

- Composition over Inheritance: This principle suggests that developers should prefer composition over inheritance when designing software. This makes code more flexible and extensible and reduces code duplication.

- Law of Demeter (LoD): The Law of Demeter suggests that objects should only communicate with their immediate neighbors and not with objects further down the chain. This reduces coupling and makes code more maintainable.

- Design Patterns: Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. Developers can use design patterns to create software that is modular, flexible, and reusable.

These principles are not exhaustive, and there may be other principles that are relevant to specific types of software. However, these principles provide a solid foundation for creating high-quality, maintainable, and efficient software.
