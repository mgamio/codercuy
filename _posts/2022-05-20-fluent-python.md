Python's effortlessness allows you to become productive rapidly yet frequently; this implies you're not utilizing all it brings. With the refreshed release of this hands-on guide, you'll figure out how to compose compelling, current Python 3 code by using its best ideas.

Don’t waste time bending Python to fit patterns you learned in other languages. Discover and apply idiomatic Python 3 features beyond your experience. Author Luciano Ramalho guides you through Python’s core language features and libraries and teaches you to make your code shorter, faster, and more readable.

Including significant updates all through the book, Fluent Python, the second version, covers:

- Special methods: The key to the consistent behavior of Python objects
- Data structures: Sequences, dicts, sets, Unicode, and data classes
- Functions as objects: First-class functions, related design patterns, and type hints in function declarations
- Object-oriented idioms: Composition, inheritance, mixins, interfaces, operator overloading, static typing and protocols
- Control flow: Context managers, generators, coroutines, async/await, and thread/process pools
- Metaprogramming: Properties, attribute descriptors, class decorators, and new class metaprogramming hooks that are simpler than metaclasse
