I was born in Lima, Peru, where I studied for 5 years and obtained a degree in System Engineering. I have been working 20 years as a Software Engineer for several companies from different economic sectors such as Government, Financial, Industrial, Educative, Consulting, Retail, and Research.

### A little more..

I have been programming in several languages such as Java, C, Cobol, C#, Visual Basic, PHP, Prolog, Python, PL/SQL and JScript. My tasks have been related to Software Development, stages of Analysis, Design, Testing, and Deployment.

During 8 years, I worked as a System Analyst for the Bank Sector. Since 2014, I am working as a Software Engineer in a B2B company in Berlin, Germany.
