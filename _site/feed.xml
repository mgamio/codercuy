<p>As with his other books, Martin’s Clean Architecture doesn’t merely present multiple choices and options, and say “use your best judgment”: it tells you what choices to make, and why those choices are critical to your success. Martin offers direct, no-nonsense answers to key architecture and design questions like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What are the best high level structures for different kinds of applications, including web, database, thick-client, console, and embedded apps?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the core principles of software architecture?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the role of the architect, and what is he/she really trying to achieve?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the core principles of software design?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do designs and architectures go wrong, and what can you do about it?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the disciplines and practices of professional architects and designers?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Clean Architecture is essential reading for every software architect, systems analyst, system designer, and software manager – and for any programmer who aspires to these roles or is impacted by their work.</p>

<p>Now, twenty years later, this new edition re-examines what it means to be a modern programmer. Topics range from personal responsibility and career development to architectural techniques for keeping your code flexible and easy to adapt and reuse. Read this book, and you’ll learn how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fight software rot</li>
  <li>Learn continuously</li>
  <li>Avoid the trap of duplicating knowledge</li>
  <li>Write flexible, dynamic, and adaptable code</li>
  <li>Harness the power of basic tools</li>
  <li>Avoid programming by coincidence</li>
  <li>Learn real requirements</li>
  <li>Solve the underlying problems of concurrent code</li>
  <li>Guard against security vulnerabilities</li>
  <li>Build teams of Pragmatic Programmers</li>
  <li>Take responsibility for your work and career</li>
  <li>Test ruthlessly and effectively, including property-based testing</li>
  <li>Implement the Pragmatic Starter Kit</li>

Now, for the first time, there’s an accessible guide to the basics of DDD: What it is, what problems it solves, how it works, and how to quickly gain value from it.</p>

<p>It is interesting the topic of Ubiquitous Language where the author emphasizes the importance of a consensual vocabulary among all team members involved in the same project. As developers, we need to choose the proper names for our variables that reflect that  Ubiquitous Language.</p>

<p>Vernon guides you through each core DDD technique for building better software. You’ll learn how to segregate domain models using the powerful Bounded Contexts pattern, to develop a Ubiquitous Language within an explicitly bounded context, and to help domain experts and developers work together to create that language. Vernon shows how to use Subdomains to handle legacy systems and to integrate multiple Bounded Contexts to define both team relationships and technical mechanisms.</p>

<p>Coverage includes</p>

<ul>
  <li>What DDD can do for you and your organization–and why it’s so important</li>
  <li>The cornerstones of strategic design with DDD: Bounded Contexts and Ubiquitous Language</li>
  <li>Strategic design with Subdomains</li>
  <li>Context Mapping: helping teams work together and integrate software more strategically</li>
  <li>Tactical design with Aggregates and Domain Events</li>
  <li>Using project acceleration and management tools to establish and maintain team cadence</li>

Multi-tiered object-oriented platforms, such as Java and .NET, have become commonplace. These new tools and technologies are capable of building powerful applications, but they are not easily implemented. Common failures in enterprise applications often occur because their developers do not understand the architectural lessons that experienced object developers have learned.</p>

<p>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture is written in direct response to the stiff challenges that face enterprise application developers. The author, noted object-oriented designer Martin Fowler, noticed that despite changes in technology–from Smalltalk to CORBA to Java to .NET–the same basic design ideas can be adapted and applied to solve common problems. With the help of an expert group of contributors, Martin distills over forty recurring solutions into patterns. The result is an indispensable handbook of solutions that are applicable to any enterprise application platform.</p>

<p>Armed with this book, you will have the knowledge necessary to make important architectural decisions about building an enterprise application and the proven patterns for use when building them.</p>

<p>The topics covered include</p>

<p>· Dividing an enterprise application into layers</p>

<p>· The major approaches to organizing business logic</p>

<p>· An in-depth treatment of mapping between objects and relational databases</p>

<p>· Using Model-View-Controller to organize a Web presentation</p>

<p>· Handling concurrency for data that spans multiple transactions</p>

<p>· Designing distributed object interfaces</p>

<p>What kind of work will you be doing? You’ll be reading code—lots of code. And the book will challenge you to think about what’s right about that code and what’s wrong with it. More importantly, it will challenge you to reassess your professional values and commitment to your craft.</p>

<p>Clean code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code—of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes how we think when we write, read, and clean code.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Readers will come away from this book’s understanding.</li>
  <li>How to tell the difference between good and bad Code</li>
  <li>How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code</li>
  <li>How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes</li>
  <li>How to format code for maximum readability</li>
  <li>How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic</li>
  <li>How to unit test and practice test-driven development</li>
</ul>

<p>This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst interested in producing better code.</p>

This Jolt award-winning classic has been thoroughly updated to take full advantage of the latest language and library features. The support in modern Java for multiple paradigms increases the need for specific best-practices advice, and this book delivers.</p>

<p>As in previous editions, each chapter of Effective Java, Third Edition, consists of several “items,” each presented in a short, stand-alone essay that provides specific advice, insight into Java platform subtleties, and updated updates code examples. The comprehensive descriptions and explanations for each item illuminate what to do, what not to do, and why.</p>

<p>The third edition covers language and library features added in Java 7, 8, and 9, including the functional programming constructs added to its object-oriented roots. Many new items have been added, including a chapter devoted to lambdas and streams.</p>

<p>New coverage includes</p>

<ul>
  <li>Functional interfaces, lambda expressions, method references, and streams</li>
  <li>Default and static methods in interfaces</li>
  <li>Type inference, including the diamond operator for generic types</li>
  <li>The @SafeVarargs annotation</li>
  <li>The try-with-resources statement</li>
  <li>New library features such as the Optional interface, Java.time, and the convenience factory methods for collections</li>
